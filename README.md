# TowerDistanceShortest


Pre-Interview Programming Task

Using your favourite development environment/language (preferably C# or Javascript) please write an application or function which takes a string as input.
The string contains a comma separated list of numbers. Each pair of numbers is the x,y coordinates of a mobile phone mast. The application needs to output the index and coordinates of the pair of masts which are closest to each other.
The distance between 2 sets of coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) can be calculated as follows :-

Dx = x1-x2 Dy = y1-y2
Distance = Sqrt( (Dx * Dx) + (Dy * Dy) )

Example:
String Input: ”50,50,54,79,90,100,54,60,10,12,1,1”
Output: “Tower0(50,50)and Tower3(54,60)areclosesttoeachother”
